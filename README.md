# ForestFire

A simple model to simulate a forest fire - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest-fire_model

This is an application built in C# using WinForms (yeah, I know... WinForms is pretty old)... WinForms offers a pretty easy way for programmatically drawing things (in a PictureBox). I got frustrated with trying to implement basic drawing with WPF.
